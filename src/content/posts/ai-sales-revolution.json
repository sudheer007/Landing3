      "content": "When we started building Graycommit, we had a simple but audacious vision: what if every sales conversation could be guided by AI intelligence in real-time? Not just post-call analysis, but live coaching that helps reps close more deals while they're happening. Today, that vision is becoming reality for thousands of sales teams."

      "content": "Despite billions spent on CRM systems, sales training, and process optimization, most sales teams still operate like they did 20 years ago. Reps memorize scripts, hope they remember the right talking points, and cross their fingers that they'll catch buyer signals. The result? Inconsistent performance, missed opportunities, and frustrated teams."
