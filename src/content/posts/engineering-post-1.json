Here's how we built an infrastructure that scales seamlessly.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">The Challenge</h3><p>Our AI models need to process audio streams, analyze conversation context, and deliver actionable insights in real-time. The technical challenges were:</p><ul class=\"list-disc pl-5 space-y-2\"><li>Sub-100ms latency requirements for real-time coaching</li><li>Processing multiple concurrent audio streams</li><li>Maintaining conversation context across long sales calls</li><li>Scaling horizontally during peak usage hours</li></ul><h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">Our Solution</h3><p>We implemented a microservices architecture with the following components:</p><ul class=\"list-disc pl-5 space-y-2\"><li><strong>Real-time Audio Processing:</strong> WebRTC for low-latency audio streaming</li><li><strong>AI Inference Pipeline:</strong> GPU-optimized containers with model caching</li><li><strong>Context Management:</strong> Redis-based session storage for conversation history</li><li><strong>Auto-scaling:</strong> Kubernetes HPA based on custom metrics</li></ul>",
